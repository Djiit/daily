## Tasks in Code Blocks
```markdown

- [x] This one too
```

## Tasks in Quotes
> - [ ] This task is in a blockquote
> - [x] Completed task in blockquote

## Empty Lines and Spacing
- [ ] Task with normal spacing

- [ ] Task with extra line above

- [ ]    Task with extra spaces
- [x]Task with no space after checkbox

## Very Long Tasks
- [ ] This is a very long task description that goes on and on and might test how the parser handles really long task descriptions that could potentially cause issues with formatting or storage in the system when displayed or processed by various components of the application

## Tasks with Special Characters
- [ ] Task with Ã©mojis ðŸš€ and spÃ«cial chars Ã¡Ã©Ã­Ã³Ãº
- [ ] Task with "quotes" and 'apostrophes'
- [ ] Task with [brackets] and (parentheses)
